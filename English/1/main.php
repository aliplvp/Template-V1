            A conversation with Seyyed Ali Mojani, cataloger, scholar and interested in historical and political studies
            In old books, lithographs and manuscripts, sometimes interesting material is found. Even you can find your lost in these books. Your missing one may be a year of death, a year of birth or even a recipe for a special food during the Safavid period. Your lost image can be a picture of Imam Baqi's shrine, which is suddenly found in a historical album. In this regard, I am having a conversation with Mr. Seyed Ali Mojani, cataloger, research copyist and interested in historical and political studies.
            Mr. Mojani, greetings and courtesy, and thank you for the opportunity you gave us to have a historical conversation about Baqi and its place. Before entering the discussion, I would like to ask about the story of the picture of Imam Baqi's shrine, peace be upon him, and how to obtain and identify it. An image that is one of the most used symbols among Shiites today. I am at your service.
            Mr. Ali Mojani:
            In fact, I came across this photo by God's grace and connected with it completely by accident. In 2017, I was studying history
            I was in Iraq and spent some time in Istanbul visiting archives, libraries and research centers.
            In these collections, I came across one of the most important archives that belongs to Istanbul University and contains the albums of Sultan Abdul Hamid's era. Sultan Abdul Hamid II ruled the Ottoman Empire for a long time and is the approximate counterpart of Naser al-Din Shah, and just as for Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, who was at the same time as him, the invention of the photographic camera was attractive to him as a new phenomenon, for the Ottoman Sultan this is also It has been an important issue. The only difference was that Sultan Abd al-Hamid used a photographic camera to verify the reports of his pashas, governors and agents in the Ottoman territory who were in Asia, Africa and Europe. In the sense that they took funds from the Ottoman government and used these funds to build and develop the areas under their control; Build a building, a road, a port, a mosque, a school, a hospital, and an orphanage, and what part of these projects has the Sultan gone ahead with? He sends a group to the areas under his command to take pictures of these projects and observe how the project has progressed and also to have a large picture or a collection of pictures of the world under the Ottoman rule. Date.
            These works have been collected and today they are in the archives of Istanbul State University.
            I had visited there and was flipping through the albums related to Iraq until I reached the albums of Mecca and Medina, Haramin Sharifin and these albums were finished. Then they said that there is a collection of these works in the Ankara State Library. I went to Ankara again and there I referred to the Ankara city library and I was studying and observing this collection which was a complement to them, now why was it there... Suddenly I saw this photo in that collection. We had a series of historical findings and historical narratives from the reports given by travel writers, and this was consistent with this collection and
            Because I had seen the pictures of the two holy shrines in Istanbul, which had a faded and invisible image of the blessed tomb of our Imams in Baqi, it caught my attention and I said to the lady who was there, where is this picture for? And Ishan said that I think there is one of the blessed centers of Sufis in Turkestan. It was very strange for me. I said that there is Baqi here, and of course they knew, because they knew the Ottoman territory well and were archivists. They said, what reason do you have to prove this? I told you to see that the photos here and the photos of Istanbul University have this relationship and they are a collection. At first, they did not accept, but then they approached and said that if it is, we will give you this photo, and then I took copies of it.
            And I brought it to Iran.
